# docker-companion

A bad reimplementation of docker-compose that you control through Matrix.

> Insert here an awesome gif of some containers being controlled by speaking

## Installation

You need to have Crystal installed, see
[instructions](https://crystal-lang.org/install/).

Clone the following repository, go into the folder, then type `make`.

## Usage

You need a file named `config.yaml` in the folder you will run your companion.

```
matrix:
  homeserver: the url of your homeserver
  access_token: an access token for the bot's account
users:
  - a list of
  - users allowed
  - to talk to the bot
  - in the form @username:server.net
```

Then you can run `/path/to/docker-companion/bin/docker-companion`.

Upon start it will scan the current directory.
For any directory containing a `docker-compose.yaml` file, it will read it,
**drop any running containers** for this project, and start new ones.

## Features

This project tries to mimic docker-compose, so it will:
* create a network for each project
* attach the containers to the project network
* resolve relative paths in volumes to absolutes ones

You can invite the bot and interact with it.
The currently available commands are:
* `images`:Â list local docker images
* `networks`: list docker networks
* `projects`: list loaded projects
* and of course `help`

Docker-compose features supported:
* specifying the container's name
* mapping ports
* restart policy
* binds-mounts (aka volumes with a path as source)
* environment vars
* labels

Major docker-compose features not supported:
* command and entrypoint
* network (other than the default one)
* build an image from a Dockerfile
* named volumes (not bind mounts)
* scaling and all docker swarm related things
* and a lot more

Specific points:
* labels must use the dictionnary form
* read-only mode for bind mounts is not supported
* networks other than "default" are not created and must exist

### Naming

The naming is a bit different from the docker-compose's one:
  * for containers (if `container_name` is not provided):
    `${project_name}_${serivce_name}`
  * for the default network: `${project_name}_network`
  * the project name is the folder's name, like docker-compose does

This means the companion will not recognize containers created with docker-compose
for the same project, and so will not destroy them.
It is up to you to manage them.

You probably want to use either docker-compose or this project but not both at
the same time with the same project.

## Todo

The goal of this project is to monitor your containers for you, and to warn you
through Matrix. This means:
* when a new image is available for a container
* when a container fails

Then the bot should offer some commands:
* restart a container with the new image
* rollback to a previous image (the companion will maintain an history of images
  for a tag)
* restart a container
* show a container's logs

Maybe after that:
* do not destroy containers at boot, but warn the user for diffs
* add projets directly from Matrix
* edit projects from Matrix

## Development

Install the depencies with `shards install`.

`make test` runs the tests, and `make lint` runs the formater plus a linter.
`make run` runs the code, `make` builds a binary.
